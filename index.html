                  <h2>Dear Preply Team,</h2>
                  <p>I have always been in love with language.</p>
                  <p>Not just speaking it, but studying it, understanding why one word builds connection while another creates distance. Linguistics was never simply an academic subject for me; it was a way of observing the world and the invisible threads that connect people through meaning.</p>
                  <p>Over time, that curiosity became a craft. I sometimes joke that I became a “localization wizard.” Not because I perform tricks but because translating one idea from one language into another, while preserving its tone, intent, and emotional weight, has always felt like a quiet kind of magic.</p>
                  <p>And the first time that quiet magic became real for me was shortly after I graduated.</p>
                  <p>My first student found me through Preply.</p>
                  <p>That lesson became my first income as a linguist. With that money, I bought myself a simple mug which is a small milestone that I still keep today. It reminds me of the moment language stopped being theoretical and became responsibility. It became trust placed in me by someone I had never met before. It became proof that words could build connection across distance.</p>
                  <p>What stayed with me from that experience was something simple: progress does not happen in one perfect moment. It happens lesson by lesson. Conversation by conversation.</p>
                  <p>In many ways, I grew alongside the idea that practice makes it perfect - not as a slogan, but as something lived. Every session refined my teaching. Every piece of feedback improved my clarity. Every small adjustment strengthened trust.</p>
                  <p>As my career evolved, my focus moved beyond crafting individual sentences and into strengthening the systems behind them. Working with multilingual vendors, building QA frameworks, conducting root cause analysis, and maintaining linguistic assets taught me that quality is not a final checkpoint. It is infrastructure. It lives in feedback loops, preventative standards, and aligned ecosystems that make continuous improvement possible.</p>
                  <p>Using Preply as both a tutor and a learner deepened that belief. I experienced how subtle wording influences motivation and retention. I saw how feedback mechanisms scale quality across markets. It shifted my thinking from “Is this translation correct?” to “Is this ecosystem strong enough to sustain trust over time?”</p>
                  <p>That realization is exactly why I am applying for the Localization Quality & Vendor Manager role at Preply.</p>
                  <p>Preply is no longer just a growing company. It is a platform shaping how people learn across the world. And at that scale, quality cannot rely on good intentions alone. It needs structure. It needs clarity. It needs people who care about the details and the systems behind them.</p>
                  <p>I want to be part of building that.</p>
                  <p>I want to contribute not only as someone who loves language, but as someone who understands the responsibility behind it which is the responsibility of making sure that clarity, trust, and confidence are consistent, no matter the language or market.</p>
                  <p>Localization quality, to me, is not about control. It is about stewardship, protecting the experience so that every learner and tutor feels equally supported.</p>
                  <p>This is the first time I have chosen to present my application in this way. I did it because Preply was not just another platform in my career but it was where my professional journey truly began. I wanted this to reflect how I think, how I care, and how seriously I take the work of building quality that lasts.</p>
                  <p>Preply was part of my beginning.</p>
                  <p>Now, I want to help strengthen the foundations that allow millions of people to keep progressing - lesson by lesson, language by language.</p>
                  <p>Best Regards,<br />Duygu TAŞ</p>
